				" A 5v5 character-based tactical shooter. Imagine this: tactical shooter meets hypernatural powers. Everyoneâ€™s got guns and a unique set of abilities, so how do you beat someone with the speed of wind? Use your own moves to outplay them and beat them to the shot. VALORANT is a game for bold strategists who dare to make the unexpected play, because if it wins, it works",
